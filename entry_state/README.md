# Entry State

## Eclipse Reminder (Only if your IDE is Eclipse based)

If you are using *Eclipse* as your IDE, you will need to import this exercise if you have not already done so.

When importing an exercise into *Eclipse* make sure you always do the following:

1. Close *all open tabs* in Eclipse.
2. Collapse the *current and completed* exercise project folder.
3. Select `File > Import` to run the `Import Wizard` and import the next exercise.

## Instructions

Before we begin coding, we want to verify that the entry state we will initialize our first exercise from is working as expected.

1. Run the `run` command to verify the main class `RestaurantApp` boots up as expected.
2. Run the `test` command to verify the initial state works as expected.
3. Run the `next` command to move to and initialize the first exercise that you will do some coding.
