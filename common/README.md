# Common Library

## Eclipse Reminder (Only if your IDE is Eclipse based)

If you are using *Eclipse* as your IDE, you will need to import this exercise if you have not already done so.

When importing an exercise into *Eclipse* make sure you always do the following:

1. Close *all open tabs* in Eclipse.
2. Collapse the *current and completed* exercise project folder.
3. Select `File > Import` to run the `Import Wizard` and import the next exercise.

## Instructions

This is the `common` project used for all exercises. The first thing we want to do is verify this project is working properly.

1. Run the `test` command to verify that `common` works as expected.
2. Run the `next` command to advance to the next exercise.
3. *HINT*: Remember, to always execute the `man` command for each exercise!
