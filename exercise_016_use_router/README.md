## Instructions

In this exercise, we will introduce parallelism through the use of routers.

1. Get rid of the bottleneck by using a router for the `Chef`.
2. Use an externally configured `round-robin` pool router.
3. Run the `run` command to boot the `RestaurantApp` with different router configuration options and watch the throughput.
4. Run the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
    - *Remember* to make sure all tests for this exercise pass before running `next`.
5. Run the `next` command to move to and initialize the next exercise.
